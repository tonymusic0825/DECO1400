                    <h1>Hi there!</h1>
                    <p>I'm Youngsu (Tony), a 25-year-old from South Korea currently studying in Australia, with a passion in Artificial Intelligence, 
                       and building creative solutions through code.
                        
                       My journey began in 2016 when I watched the iconic Alphago vs Lee Sedol match. Though bittersweet, it sparked my fascination 
                       with AI and set me on the path I'm on today. I enrolled in the Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Queensland in 
                       2019, but due to COVID-19 and mandatory military service, I paused my studies until 2024. During that time, I focused on 
                       self-studying machine learning and honing my development skills.
                        
                       I returned to university in 2024 and plan to graduate in 2025. Growing up between Korea and Australia, 
                       my love for tech started with video games and evolved into a deep interest in solving real-world problems with code. 
                       Today, I'm excited by the possibilities of software and the potential of AI to shape the future.

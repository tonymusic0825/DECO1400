# Portfolio Website
##### For DECO1400 Website Implementation - Youngsu Choi (UQ 2025 Sem 1)

Designed to serve as an **alternative CV** for recruiters, employers, and academics.

## Purpose

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

No frameworks or build tools — pure front-end implementation.
